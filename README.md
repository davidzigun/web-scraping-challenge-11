# web-scraping-challenge-11
Information from the Nasa data provided in the challenge was scraped using Splinter for automated opening of the browser page and Beautiful Soup to extract the data from the HTML code.
The resulting data was converted to Pandas dataframes using Pandas library commands and matplotlib for the graphs.

The resulting information allowed for the analysis of average highest and lowest temperature and pressure on Mars, as well as the average number of days in the Martian year, using observations of temperature patterns to determine the orbit of Mars around the sun.
